            <h6>last updated: June 2, 2020</h6>
            <p>I'm hoping to move back to SF in June (once SIP lifts).</p>
            <p>Iâ€™m currently reading Thinking, Fast and Slow and recently finished 6 Easy Pieces</p>
            <p>With the summer upon us, I've been running more. Given the SF marathon is cancelled this year, I'd like to organize a marathon or half-marathon with a few folks.</p>
            <p>My favorites of the past few months: newsletter (Matt Levine), twitter account (@dwr, @chetanp, @andrew__reed), blog (), book (Hard Drive)</p>
