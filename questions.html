            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <p>Where does our lack of creativity or rigor leave us ignorant? E.g., <a href="https://www.xaprb.com/blog/flight-is-impossible/" target="_blank">technology</a>, <a href="https://divinations.substack.com/p/oatly-the-new-coke" target="_blank">health</a>.</p>
            <p>How will the tech regulatory environment in the US change given the following: a world of 4 distinct technology powers (US, EU, India, China), a divided congress, and tech companies that understand the innovator's dilemma/Microsoft antitrust.</p>
            <p>Is there something unique about the local/targeted nature of cable TV and the internet that creates a level of partisanship that wasnâ€™t present in local radio stations and newspapers?</p>
            <p>Can North American cities ever be re-designed for public transit and bikes as opposed to cars?</p>
            <p>Is there something analogous to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff" target="_blank">exponential backoff</a> in changing habits? The longer one is forced to change their habits the (exponentially) longer these habit changes will stay after they're no longer forced.</p>
            <p>How much do our actions and what we've learned before we're 20 influence us for the rest of our life? How often do people change their minds after the age of 20, 30 and 40? Are there certain categories of things people are more likely to allow themselves to change their minds on?</p>
            <p>Why does working hard in school attract praise while working hard in one's career attract concern?</p>
            <!--<p>Are the problems that crypto/blockchain attempts to solve better resolved via activism and the UN?</p>
            <p>What is needed to allow for a direct democracy?</p>-->
