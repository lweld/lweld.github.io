            <h2>Developing Now for Mars</h2>
            <h6>published: March 26, 2016</h6>
            <p>Colonizing a new planet gets people talking about big problems — problems that up until that point have disguised themselves as accepted ways of life. When recently asked how Mars should be governed, Elon Musk suggested it adopt a direct democracy. Under this system, citizens vote directly on issues, as opposed to placing the power in the hands of a few political representatives. Due to the speed of communication over the internet, this is the first time in history that something like this could be pulled off.</p>
            <p>I like Elon’s idea so much that I don’t think we have to wait for the eventual colonization of another planet to change our political structure. <i>I propose we move one technologically advanced municipality to a direct democracy.</i> A district like the one Palo Alto falls in would work. At the next election, along with the names of regular candidates, give citizens the option to vote for the implementation of the first direct democracy. If a direct democracy is chosen, citizens would be notified of relevant issues via email or social media, authenticate themselves, vote, and then watch as these collective votes hold the same power as an elected representative. A similar system could then be used to enact change in their local government.</p>
            <p>A direct democracy would have the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Give citizens a greater sense of ownership</li>
                <li>Remove petty, wasteful arguments politicians find themselves in</li>
                <li>Remove concentration of power</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One argument against this is that the political process could become even more chaotic since you’re relying on the emotions of the crowds. I disagree. Politicians already favour the public’s opinion.</p>
            <p>The most notable argument against this is that it may not collect the most representative opinions of a population; senior citizens are less likely to engage. I agree and this is the largest reason to delay implementing a direct democracy.</p>
            <p>Maybe I don’t know enough about politics and for one reason or another this wouldn’t work. In this likely scenario, I would like to remind those reading that: 1) as of now this is a way to stir conversation, and 2) the first iteration of an idea is never the last.</p>
            <p class="horizontal-line"></p>
            <p>Update, November 9, 2016: If representatives were still to be used, what if the idea of a political party could be removed? All politicians would run as independents and would get policy buy-in from other politicians through active dialogue (not due to pressure from the organization that you both belong to). In light of Trump’s election, this may be a good idea.</p>
