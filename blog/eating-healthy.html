            <h2>Eating Healthy</h2>
            <h6>June 22, 2020</h6>
            <p>People often try to eat healthy to improve their appearance and/or prevent health issues. I don’t think either motivation serves us well long-term.</p>
            <p>Trying to impress people with our appearance makes us too focused on public opinion. Doing so lets others determine our decisions and success. In other domains, we recognize that doing something to please others isn’t a good way to condition ourselves, yet we do it all the time when it comes to our physical appearance. Plus, becoming fixated on our appearance is a slippery slope into becoming overly focused on ourselves, which makes us selfish and increases our tendency to overvalue our ideas.</p>
            <p>Eating well with the goal of improving our health is incredibly tough unless you’re currently facing a health crisis. Health is an abstract idea that we only consider in moments of sickness and quickly forget about once we’re healthy again. We all understand that healthy habits significantly impact our quality of life as we age. But, if you aren’t a senior citizen or suffer from a chronic condition, health feels like something to punt as it isn’t a near-term concern.</p>
            <p>Both motivations are baked in fear. Fear can be a strong motivator in short bursts but rarely holds up over the long-term (not to mention it reduces our quality of life).</p>
            <p class="horizontal-line"></p>
            <p>For many years I was an eat-healthy-to-look-good person, with a sprinkle of eat-healthy-to-improve-health. This was frustrating for the reasons I mentioned above.</p>
            <p>In 2017 I had a roommate who was the healthiest eater I have ever come across. He never ate sugar and lived off tomatoes, avocados, berries, beans, rye bread, eggs, greek yogurt, and peanut butter. He was tall with a naturally athletic build. He clearly didn’t have to eat this way to stay fit. I asked him why he decided to eat so well and he said that he does so because it makes him feel great. He feels sluggish, irritable, and impulsive when he doesn’t eat well.</p>
            <p>This was one of those quake moments for me where all of my prior motivations were upended. Eating well to feel good is such a simple, obvious idea with important consequences. It changed my motivation to eat well from being rooted in fear to being rooted in happiness. It changed the frequency of my motivation from weeks (appearance) or decades (health) to hours since you can constantly benchmark how you feel.</p>
            <p>Find healthy foods you like and <i>soak in how you feel after eating them</i>. This association will make you look forward to eating healthy.</p>
            <p>Motivation isn’t easy to come across. It’s best to design a life where motivation is effortless. If you can source motivation at a high frequency and with joy, you’ll likely sustain it.</p>
