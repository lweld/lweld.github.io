            <h2>What VR Enables</h2>
            <h6>published: March 26, 2016</h6>
            <p>The development of language enabled all of humanity’s progress since language led to communication. If 50,000 years ago I saw someone being eaten by a carnivorous beast, I create a word for it, “Lion”, and tell the rest of the tribe to be mindful of it. The next generation of the tribe is aware of Lions and can build off this knowledge, maybe by making a primitive spear to protect themselves. This sets off a cycle of each generation making advancements by using the collective knowledge of all generations preceding them, which was all made possible by communication.</p>
            <p>What does Facebook do? It breaks down the barriers to communicate. Much of this communication is useless, just like much of our ancestors’ conversations invariably were. But, some are incredibly productive and that’s what matters. VR will further break down the barriers to communicate. This will spur more productive conversations in ways never before possible. When seen in this light, VR adds to the fundamental fabric that our world was built on; a conductor of great ideas that leads to great advancements. People like to talk about how exponentially fast our society has developed when compared to earlier times. I think much of this development has been the result of rapid improvements in communication. Exciting shit.</p>
